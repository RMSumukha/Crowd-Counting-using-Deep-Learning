# People Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

![People Detection](https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png)

## Overview

This project aims to detect and localize people in images using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on a custom dataset, we can achieve accurate people detection.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of images containing people.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and augment the dataset to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate pre-trained CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet).
- **Fine-Tuning**: Train the selected model on the custom dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Inference**: Use the trained model to detect people in new images.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/people-detection-cnn.git
   cd people-detection-cnn
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (images with and without people).
2. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model
   ```

4. Run inference on new images:

   ```bash
   python infer.py --image_path /path/to/test_image.jpg
   ```

## Results

Our trained model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the validation set. You can find more details in the [results.md](results.md) file.
